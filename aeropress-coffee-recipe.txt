Ingredients:
- Freshly-roasted coffee (Ideally within 5-15 days of roasting)
- Aeropress Coffee Maker
- Aeropress microfilter
- Coffee grinder
- Purified water

Directions:
 1. Heat purified water to approximately 180 degrees Fahrenheit 
 	 (minimum 8oz).
 2. Finely grind desired amount of coffee 
 	 (minimum 1 tbsp).
 	- Ideally use a commercial burr grinder
 	- A setting of '4' should be a good starting place
 		This ensures a fine texture for adequate flavor extraction
 		without being so fine as to clog the aeropress filter.
 	- As your familiarity with the press increses, feel free to 
 		experiment with alternate grind densities.
 	- Generally, as the beans age (read dessicate), you will want to
 		gradually loosen the grind to get the best flavor.
 3. Insert the Aeropress microfilter into the cartridge and screw it shut.
 4. Add 1 tablespoon of finely-ground coffee to the Eeropress chamber.
 5. Set the Aeropress chamber atop a sturdy coffee mug (with enough 
 	capacity to hold the desired amount of water).
 6. Evenly fill the Aeropress chamber with 8oz of 180-degree water.
 7. Stir for approximately ten seconds. 
 8. Align the plunger atop the Aeropress chamber and slowly press the
 	coffee-water slurry through the filter and into the coffee cup.
 	- This should take about 30 seconds to 1 minute and will require 
 		less effort with a loose grind and more effort with a tight grind.
 	- If the grind is too tight, the amount of force required will not 
 		only make this eperience unenjoyable, but could also result in
 		accidentally losing control of the mug -- not fun.
 	- If the grind is too loose, the coffee may not have enough time to 
 		brew and may end up being watery.
 	- The ideal grind provides a very satisfying amount of resistance
 		and makes the experience quite pleasureable. 
 8. Once all the liquid has been pressed from the chamber, dispose of the 
 	coffee grinds by unscrewing the cartridge and depress the plunger to eject the puck of coffee grinds.
 		- It is best to do this right after brewing to preserve the 
 			longevity of the Aeropress plunger.
 		- When unscrewing the cartridge, be careful not to scald your
 			fingers on the remaining drops of water.
 		- I like to keep a bowl handy so that I can pop the puck straight 
 			into the bowl without having to carry the aeropress over to the
 			trash can. 
 9. Give the Aeropress components a quick rinse and set to dry.
 10. Enjoy "The best cup of coffee [you've] ever had."
